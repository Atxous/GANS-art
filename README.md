First GAN. This is actually a custom made GAN with style transfer in mind. I wasn't able to do standard adversial
style transfer with my data (kaggle - "I'm something of a painter myself") so I decided to make a custom version.

# About it
So the pictures are 256 x 256 with 3 channels. GANs are generally pretty hard to train, so I took more time than I usually do with
some of my projects. This was pretty difficult.

I think I'm still going to work on this because even though it's "good enough," I'm really not satisfied. I really think a few
customizations can make it so much better. Plus, working with GANs is really fun.
